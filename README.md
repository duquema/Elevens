# Elevens

# Activity 7

Answer the student guide questions before implementing the new `ElevensBoard` class. Be sure to focus on designing a working algorithm **before** examining the provided code. Your algorithm should be written in the language of the game, not using Java or programming terms. Then continue answering the questions while working through how the partially finished `ElevensBoard` class has been designed to implement the algorithm of playing a game of Elevens.
